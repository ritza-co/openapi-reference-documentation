# OpenAPI Tutorials

Instead of jumping head-first into the specification, find an entry point that suites your current understanding and goals:

- To **learn about OpenAPI by building an API** work through our [OpenAPI tutorials](./tutorial/README.md), where we create an OpenAPI document from scratch, then generate server endpoint stubs, SDKs, and documentation.
- Follow [step-by-step guides](./guides/README.md) on **how to accomplish specific tasks using OpenAPI**.
- Reference a **detailed description** of the [OpenAPI Specification](./specification/README.md).
- Understand OpenAPI terminology by referencing the [OpenAPI Glossary](./glossary/README.md).
- Understand **OpenAPI best practices** by reading our [OpenAPI tips and advice](./tips/README.md).
- See our detailed **OpenAPI document example** in the [Speakeasy Bar API](./example/README.md).

If you have no idea where to start, we recommend working through our [OpenAPI tutorial](./tutorials/README.md) to get the wheels turning.

TODO: Two detailed tutorials to start with:

1. OpenAPI Design-First Tutorial: Design a small API using OpenAPI, and generate SDKs, server stubs, and documentation.
2. API-first OpenAPI Tutorial: Create an OpenAPI document to describe an existing API.
