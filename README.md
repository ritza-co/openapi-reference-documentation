## What is this reference for?

OpenAPI is a specification for describing RESTful APIs. Functionally, it serves as a source of truth for API tooling, documentation, and testing. As such, it is essential for developers to understand the specification.

This reference is intended to be complementary of the [official OpenAPI Specification Reference](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0). It is focused on being dev-friendly: example-based with thorough explanations, plus AI search!

If you would like to contribute to this reference, please see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What is Speakeasy

At Speakeasy we are building the toolchain to make APIs easy to create and consume.

Today, our platform allows you to create a robust developer experience for your API using an OpenAPI spec:

- [SDKs in 9 langues](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/create-client-sdks): TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift and Unity
- [Terraform Providers](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/create-terraform)

Due to the nature of our work, we spend a lot of time working with OpenAPI and have become experts on how the spec impacts downstream workflows. This reference is a way for us to give back to the community and pass on some of the learning that we've done along the way.
