# OpenAPI Specification

## Introduction to the OpenAPI Specification

TODO: Specification introduction

TODO: We recommend moving the specification from [/README.md](../README.md) here as one long document, much like the official OpenAPI Specification, but with:

- Inline examples from Speakeasy Bar API.
- Outbound links to guides.
- Outbound links to tutorial steps.
- Outbound links to best-practices and tips.
- Outbound links to SDK generation explanations.
